A simple example of jqgrid 4.0 + jquery 1.6 (adapted from the ["Loading Data" -> "Load once" demo page](http://www.trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html)).

1. Install bundler if you don't have it

    gem install bundler
    
2. Clone, bundle, and run sinatra

    git clone https://github.com/searls/jqgrid-example.git && cd jqgrid-example && bundle install && bundle exec ruby sinatra.rb
